# Diabetes-Prediction-ML-
In this project we use Supervised Learning to predict that a person has diabetes diseases or not.
We do :
  - Scrutiny Data
  - Preprocess Data
  - Learning & Evaluation

We try many methods like `K-Nearest-Neighbours`, `Decision‬‬ ‫‪Trees`, `Logistic‬‬ ‫‪Regression‬‬` and `Random Forest`.
